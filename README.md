# Numerical Methods with Fortran 90

## 1. Description

Numerical methods are tools by which it is possible to formulate and solve mathematical problems using airtmetic operations. Although there are many types of numerical methods, they share a common feature: they invariably require a number of tedious arithmetic calculations.
